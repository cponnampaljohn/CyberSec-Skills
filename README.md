# CyberSec-Skills
A compilation of skills, accolades, and documents that I encountered/have used to practice and learn relevant cybersecurity skills.
I am excited to learn more about this growing field and develop relevent skills to protect and uphold the "CIA" triad. I am looking to highlight my strengths and document my growth. I am currently a rising junior in a computer security major. I was introduced to cybersecurity through my friends and found the depth and number of roles within the field to be fascinating.
